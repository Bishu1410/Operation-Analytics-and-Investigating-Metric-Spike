Here we are trying to build a system through which we will be able to
build better business opportunities and better client interaction.
Through this operation analytics we will measure certain parameters
which in turn will help us grow as a company and also most certainly
help in understanding our flaws. By this way we would also be able to
recommend best of our services and rectify the area we are lagging
on. These operation analytics are the foundation pillar of the success
of any organisation.
Investigating metric spike is also an important part
of operation analytics as being a Data Analyst you must be able to
understand or make other teams understand questions like- Why is
there a dip in daily engagement? Why have sales taken a dip? Etc.
Questions like these must be answered daily and for that its very
important to investigate metric spike.
